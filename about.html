  About me - Who am I and What I'm going to talk about.
    <blockquote>Answer to the question "Who the hell are you?" and "What are you talking about?"</blockquote>

  About this website - <strong>Legacy</strong> and <strong>Sharing</strong>
    <blockquote>
      <li><em>Honestly, I build this website mostly for selfish reason, I need a way to keep track of my things - whatever I am thinking about or working on. I research things and document my research with a post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully, other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting.</em></li>
      <li><em>For the strong desire of <strong>Sharing</strong>, I built 2 personal site before, this site is my third generation personal publishing platform (Actually 3.5th generation), also to be an example of <strong>"The Hacker's Way"</strong> to publishing.</em></li>
    </blockquote>

  Answer to the question - "Why this site looks so ugly?"
    <blockquote><em>As a information website, the whole site is an instance of pursuing <strong>Simplicity</strong>. One thing I found out is that low quality information on the Internet are way too much more than anywhere else, We all have limited time, so, I won't waste my words and your time. I'll keep everything <strong>Simple</strong> and <strong>Stupid</strong>, so you can find the information you want in a very short time, and then leave this site to do other important things. By the way, I don't think it's ugly, I'll say it's <strong>Minimalism</strong>.</em></blockquote> 

  Two transcendent understandings - "Two things changed from the time I start writing and blogging."
    <blockquote>
      <li>I was so happy that I finally got a transcendent understanding of <strong>"The Power of Plain-Text"</strong>, which is the reason of why masters choose, use, and like this way.</li>
      <li>I prefer wrote stuff <strong>by hand on papers</strong> and input them into computer to use computer write stuff. Why by hand, D.E. Knuth had a very precisely explaination, he totally see that through.</li>
