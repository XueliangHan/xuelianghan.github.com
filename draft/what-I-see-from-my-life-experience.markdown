> The trees are strong, my lord, their roots go deep. --The Lord of Rings   
The trees in the city and the trees in the wild.  
* The trees in the city have a peace environment, they have everything, they don't need to worry about sunshine, air, water, and soil.  
* The trees in the wild have a tough environment, they are suffering, they must try hard to get sunshine, air, water, and soil, and meantime, they must go through the strom, thunder, lighting.  
* When the biggest strom appeared at both city and wild, the trees in city were uprooted by the wind, but the trees in wild still stand, boldly against the wind, and face to the sun, when the strom go, I looked at the fallen trees, their roots are so shallow.  
* The people can be trees, if I want grow up, I must get training, if I want get stronger, I must experience more, It will be tough, it will be difficult, but, it not mean it will be unhappy.
