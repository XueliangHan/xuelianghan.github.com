What is programming?
====================


###Quotes
> Programming is actually teach you how to think. -- Steve Jobs  

> Program a computer to do things for you, so you won't need to do it by yourself.

> Machine with intelligence could learn to see - and think - without the need to be programmed to do it. -- Afterward by Tomaso Poggio from Book "Vision"


###Program a computer is to tell a computer to do things for you
All things are processed as information form in a computer system, information need to be organized/structured, not scattered at everywhere, and them are transform from one structure to another structure in a computer system, which is under the control of procedures. Here, we define data is binary number: 0, 1. Information can be text, image, audio, video, structured data.
So the progress of information processing in a computing machine is:  
* Input information (That will be the problem/question with a computer acceptable form)
* Store, Process information 
* Output information (That will be the answer with computer form/human readable form)
  * In CLR age, 
  * In GUI age,  classic module is MVC. Model charge for processing information. View charge for show the result. Controler charge for control, interact with model and view, get user's action from view and tell view how to reaction/represent itself, tell model the new information(update from view/etc.) need to process, and get the result from model who have just finished process the new incoming information.

###Algorithms and Data Structure
A good data structure may solve the problem directly, take less procedures (simpler algorithms) than the old way which is underdeveloped data structure with complex algorithms, I call this __Architecture Evolution__, just same principle with Intel CPU development stragety: use 18 month to modify the architecture and another 18 month to improve the process.  
Is algorithms more important than data strcuture? or data strcut more important than algorithms?  
I don't think so, they are both important, just like eye and ear, but in some specific area, one of them may have less influence than other one.
