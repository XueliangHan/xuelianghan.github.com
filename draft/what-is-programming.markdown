What is programming?
====================

###Quotes
> Programming is actually teach you how to think. - Steve Jobs  

> How to program a computer to do things for you? 

> Machine with intelligence could learn to see - and think - without the need to be programmed to do it.  

###Program a computer is to tell a computer to do things for you
All things are processed as information form in a computer system, information need to be organized, not scattered at everywhere, and follow the procedures to transform into some other structure,
So the progress in a computing machine is:
* Input information (That will be the problem/question - computer acceptable form)
* Store, Process information 
* Output information (That will be the answer - computer form/human readable form)
  * In CLR age
  * In GUI age, information form can be binary, text, image, audio, video, classic module is MVC. Model charge for processing information. View charge for show the result. Controler charge for control, interact with model and view, get user's action from view and tell view how to reaction/represent itself, tell model the new information(update from view/etc.) need to process, and get the result from model who have just finished process the new incoming information.

A good data structure may solve the problem directly, take less procedures (simpler algorithms) than the old way which is bad data structure with complex algorithms, I call this __Architecture Evolution__, just same thought with Intel CPU development stragety: 18 month to modify the architecture and 18 month to improve the process.
Data structure is the low level of limit of proformance.
