<h1>What is programming?</h1>

<h3>Quotes about Programming</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programming is actually teach you how to think. -- Steve Jobs  </p>

<p>Machine with intelligence could learn to see - and think - without the need to be programmed to do it. -- Afterward by Tomaso Poggio from Book "Vision"</p>

<p>Program a computer to do things for you, so you won't need to do it by yourself</p>

<p>Solve problems - Borrow the power of computer technology, write a program to solve problem which can't or take lot cost to solve in tradition ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Program a computer is to tell a computer to do things for you</h3>

<p>All things are processed as information form in a computer system, information need to be organized/structured, not scattered at everywhere, and them are transform from one structure to another structure in a computer system, which is under the control of procedures. Here, we define data is binary number: 0, 1. Information can be text, image, audio, video, structured data. So the progress of information processing in a computing machine is:    </p>

<ul>
<li>Input information (That will be the problem/question with a computer acceptable form)</li>
<li>Store, Process information </li>
<li>Output information (That will be the answer with computer form/human readable form)
<ul>
<li>In CLR age,  you don't need to consider graphic interface, program the core model and write the logic, you are done.</li>
<li>In GUI age,  a classic model to build a program is MVC (Model-View-Controler). Model charged for processing information. View charged for showing the result. Controler charged for controling the all part, such as: interact with model and view, get user's action from view and tell view how to reaction/represent itself, tell model the new information(updated from view/etc.) need to process, and get the result from model who have just finished process the new incoming information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithms and Data Structure</h3>

<p>Problems can be solved by approrite <em>Algorithms</em>, <em>Data Structure</em>, and a good <em>Design</em>.  </p>

<p>A good data structure may solve the problem directly, take less procedures (simpler algorithms) than the old way which is underdeveloped data structure with complex algorithms, I call this <strong>Architecture Evolution</strong>, just same principle with Intel CPU development stragety: use 18 month to modify the architecture and another 18 month to improve the process.  </p>

<p>Is algorithms more important than data strcuture? or data strcut more important than algorithms? <br />
I don't think so, they are both important, just like eye and ear, but in some specific area, one of them may have less influence than other one.   </p>
