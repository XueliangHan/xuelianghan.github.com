What I see from my life experience
----------------------------------
* Answer
  * Ultimately, the tough questions' answer are go down to some fundamental thoughts like "what I pursuit?", "what I believe?", "who I want to be?".

* Cognition
  * If you look back to the origin, you will find that all mistakes are from the wrong cognition at beginning.

###Tree - The trees in the city and the trees in the wild.  
> The trees are strong, my lord, their roots go deep. --The Lord of Rings   
* The trees in the city have a peace environment, they have everything, they don't need to worry about sunshine, water, and soil.  
* The trees in the wild have a tough environment, they are suffering, they must try hard to get sunshine, water, and soil, and meantime, they must go through the strom, thunder, lighting.  
* When the biggest strom approach both city and wild, the trees in city were uprooted by the wind, but the trees in wild still stand, boldly against the wind, and face to the sun, when the strom past, I looked at the fallen trees, their roots are so shallow.  
* The people can be trees, if I want grow up, I must get training, if I want get stronger, I must experience more, It will be tough, it will be difficult, but, it not mean it will be unhappy.

* The way of publishing information about oneself, introduce oneself to others, let others know you.

* The original way
  * Build a website put all information on it, such as: TEXT(Article, blog, note, guide, etc.), IMAGE(photos, graphics), VIDEO(interview, speech, documentary). But this gonna need lots of time and energy, and knowledge, skills, techniques to do this, and at higher level, people are separated, they can't connect to each other.
