Publishing
The way of publishing information about oneself, introduce oneself to others, let others know you.

The original way
Build a website put all information on it, such as: TEXT(Article, blog, note, guide, etc.), IMAGE(photos, graphics), VIDEO(interview, speech, documentary). But this gonna need lots of time and energy, and knowledge, skills, techniques to do this, and at higher level, people are separated, they can't connect to each other.  

The modern way - Stand on the giant's shoulder (Use other's best tools)
* Social-Network.News(Latest Info): Twitter
* Social-Network.Primary(General About Me): Facebook
* Social-Network.Career(Professional): LinkedIn
* Social-Network.Life(Close Friend): Path
* Social-Project: Github

The extra way - Nothing meet your demand (Do it by yourself)
* Write a home page, linked all links about you, and introduce/descript it to people who visit.
