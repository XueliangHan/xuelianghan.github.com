      <ul><!-- The Best: Except LISP, others are all same, so it doesn't matter anymore -->
        <!-- Functional Matter(Molecule) - Treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoid state and mutable data
             LISP(Scheme, Common Lisp, Clojure), Haskell, Erlong(Concurrent), Scala --><!-- C#: lambda, Linq -->
          <a href="./cs/pl/LISP.html">LISP</a><!-- Can't make money but fun -->
      </ul>

      <ul><!-- Make a living: Java, Python/JavaScript -->
        <!-- 1.Procedure Oriented Matter(Molecule):
             18% C -->

             Advantage (Strength): Build large system 10 times faster and better - Steve Jobs)
             Disvantage (Weakness):

        <!-- 3.Script Matter(Molecule)
             Advantage (Strength): High level language, powerful, less code so more things, build things fast
             Disadvantage (Weakness): Have their maxmium capacity, but still hold a meduim website; Can't reach C/C++/Java level
             Usage: Most non-CS Major people (Scientist, Engineer, Student, Researcher use it
             Python/JavaScript: One is OK
             1.3% JavaScript - Running in the broswer
             3.8% Python
             1.7% Ruby - With killer app "Rails" dominates the community which more web-focussed, commonly used as a "Web" language
             0.6% Lua - Commonly used as a "Game" language in game industry due to lightweight said by a game developer on StackOverflow

          <a href="./cs/pl/python.html">Python (Lift Short, Use Python)</a><!-- Python Enormous Libraries -->
