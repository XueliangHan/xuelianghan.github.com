#const
* Quote 01: The standard modelof physics has dozens of _constants_ that need to be precisely what they are, or atoms would not have been possible, and where would have been no stars, no planets, no brains, and no books on brains. - How to Creat a Mind by Kurzweil, Introduction
* Once you use _const_, that means the things you __defined__ with const will never, ever be changed.
