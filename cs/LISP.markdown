LISP Dialect
------------
* The word "Dialect" which people named LISP family is actually a myth, not a right and very percisely description to the truth. The truth is, Dialects are another language, the reason that the languages like MIT-Scheme, Common LISP are called LISP dialect is not because they are different implemention of LISP which based on some specific modifications of orignal design but they are based on S-Experssion, in my opinion, dialect is a name of language which based on Experssion.
