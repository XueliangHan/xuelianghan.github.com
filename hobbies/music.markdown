###Music so great? What we do about music? What people's action about music
_Publications_ and _recordings_ have effectively internationalized music in its most significant, as well as its most trivial, manifestations. Beyond all this, the _teaching_ of music is primary and secondary schools has now attained virtually worldwide acceptance.


###My own theory

Just image the patterns in music are like computer programs, human brain can excutes the programs, as a consequence, human changed somethings (emotion, behaviour).
