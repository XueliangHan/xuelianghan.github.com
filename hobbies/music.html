<h1>MUSIC</h1>

<h2>What is Music</h2>

<h3>Music is a <em>protean</em> <strong>art</strong></h3>

<p>Song: It lends itself <em>easily</em> to alliances with <strong>words</strong>, as in <em>song</em>.
Dance: <strong>Song</strong> with <strong>physical movement</strong>, as in dance.
Ritual and drama: Music is adjunct to.</p>

<h3>Music can <em>reflect</em> and <em>influence</em> human <strong>Emotion</strong>.</h3>

<p>[<strong>Capacity</strong>] Music has been credited with the capacity to <em>reflect</em> and <em>influence</em> human <strong>emotion</strong>, and that <em>possibilities</em> was _ consistently exploited_ by popular culture, <em>most conspicuously</em> today by means of <em>radio</em>, <em>film</em>, <em>television</em>, and the <em>musical theatre</em>.</p>

<h3>Music can <em>effect</em> human <strong>behaviour</strong></h3>

<p>The <em>implications</em> of uses of music in <em>psychotherapy</em>, <em>geriatrics</em>, and <em>advertising</em> testify to a faith in its power to effect <strong>human behaviour</strong>.</p>

<h2>Music so great? What we do about music? What people's action about music</h2>

<p><em>Publications</em> and <em>recordings</em> have effectively internationalized music in its most significant, as well as its most trivial, manifestations. Beyond all this, the <em>teaching</em> of music is primary and secondary schools has now attained virtually worldwide acceptance.</p>

<h2>My own theory</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pattern Sympathetic Vibration: Music contain <strong>patterns</strong>, if the music pattern is close/similar to the patterns from human brain conciousness or activity, then <strong>Pattern Synpathetic Vibration</strong> will appeared, and the pattern in brain will turning to the pattern in music. Just image the patterns in music are like computer programs, human brain can excutes the programs, as a consequence, human changed somethings (emotion, behaviour).</li>
</ul>
