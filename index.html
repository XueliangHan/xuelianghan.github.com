            <blockquote>You should pay your attention on Google's "Borg", not Twitter. Borg is Google's cloud infrastructure, "Borg" comes from science fiction StarTrek, it connect everyone and consider the whole as one, Google don't want many computer, engineers just want one, one big supper powerful computer, but the limit of our physical world make it impossible to archive that goal on one physical machine, so Google use tens of thousand machine and build another system running on them which below all application and only above the operating system.</blockquote>
             <!-- <li>Next article is "Google's Omega", Version 2 of "Borg", "Omega" is the last word of Greek letters, I guess it means the final system Google had ever build, it represent the highest level of human engineering capacity. -->

        About this site:
        <blockquote><em>For the strong desire of <strong>Sharing</strong>, I built 2 personal site before (there are still lots of data in there which I haven't transfered yet), this site is my third generation personal publishing platform (Actually 3.5th generation), also to be an example of <strong>"The Hacker's Way"</strong> to publishing. And one thing I found is that low quality information on the Internet are way too much more than anywhere else. We all have limited time, so, I won't waste my words and your time.</em></blockquote>
        Answer to the Question - "Why this site looks so ugly?"
        <blockquote><em>As a information site, I'll keep everything <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>clean</strong>, so you can find the information you want in a very short time, and then leave this site to do other important things. By the way, I was so happy that I finally got a transcendent understanding of "The Power of Plain-Text", which is the reason of why masters choose, use, and like this way, by the way, I don't think it's ugly, I'll say it's minimal (quite simple and clean).</em></blockquote>
