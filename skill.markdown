####Concepts and Definition of Time Management

####Evening Time
* __Evening Time__ - I mean the time begin from you back to home from outside (after work and/or social activities), and end at the time you go sleep.

* The problem I realized
  * One thing (Actually it's a fact to me) I observed and learned from my internship at Inspiry is that I will be exhausted when I back to home, through body is tired, but the mind was more tired than body, but in that week, I found that I had __DONE__ nothing through I was still doing things when I back to home, because the mind is not on working state, it seems to be still working, but not efficient and not effective too, so that 3 to 5 hours are totally wasted.

* The solution I figured out to give a shot
  * The idea behind my solution is easy to understand, and it make sense too. The body and the mind both need rest to repair damage or do something else, just let them do it, go to sleep after back home.

* If MIND tired
  * BODY exhausted and eye can't open -> Go to sleep, wake up __early__ after 7/8 hours sleep (maybe at 4/5/6), goto "Morning Time", deal tough stuff and get them done.
* If MIND tired but can't sleep
  * BODY tired - > "Happy accident", "Waster" 2 hours, do unusual stuff.
  * BODY good - > Do some body work (Exercise/Sport/Fitness, Routine housework, ...)
* If MIND good
  * BODY good -> sit down, do some tough work.
  * BODY tired -> Hold on and sit down, do some work (blogging, writing, reading)
  * BODY exhausted -> Lay down on soft bed, do some _Light-weight_ MIND work (review)


####"The Happy Accident" - 2 hours a day just don't do things normally do, "waste" it.
  * The _idea_ behind this thought is to contact/connect with more things/people. The infinite possibility of the interaction between yourself and the real actual physical world, just relax and release your mind, let new `information` in, and in a state of `Chaos`, new connections will be made in you mind, and amazing things may happen.

  * _Richard Feynman_ - Always keep 12 questions in you mind, when interesting things happened, check if you can get some new thoughts about that 12 question, over time, people will call you `Genius`.
  * _John Nash_ - Solve a very important problem after seeing a beautiful woman in a bar.
  * (Idea) Develop a `computer program/ website/ mobile app` to assist this 2 _Wonderful_ hours more __Wonderful__.
