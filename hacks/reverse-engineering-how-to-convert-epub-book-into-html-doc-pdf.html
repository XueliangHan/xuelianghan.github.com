<h2>1.Convert ePub book into HTML</h2>

<ol>
<li>Decompress: epub actually is a zip file, decompress it, you get all files,</li>
<li>Move non-html files, keep it, you will need it.</li>
<li>Extract each file's content which is between the label <head> and </body></li>
<li>Rename the file extension name to .txt, because the program can only handle .txt, that's OK, it's txt after all</li>
<li>Merge all split files into one .txt file, named merged.txt</li>
<li>HTML Structure Integrity: Finish the HTML markup
<ul>
<li>Add these into head of merged.txt
<blockquote>
  <p><?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></li>
<li>Add this into end of merged.txt
</html>
It will be fine if you don't do this and open it in Chrome, but I prefer DONE.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rename marged.txt to merged.html, and move other files back, reverse what you do in step 2
Note: Finis the task with tools, you search software (TextForever.exe on windows) or write a program (script on Linux).</li>
</ol></p>

<h2>I'm curious which programming language are you going to pick?</h2>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>C, C++: Oh, come on, buddy, are you really going to do this?</li>
<li>Bash: You are an administrator.</li>
<li>Java: Yeah, good one, java.utilities.reg is nice, but don't you think Eclipse is a little big and heavy? Or you are gonna do this in CLR? That's fine.</li>
<li>Perl, Python, Ruby: Yeah, that's all good choices.</li>
<li>PHP, JavaScript: Its fine too I think.</li>
<li>LISP: I don't think you need continue reading this instruction, you will figure it out on your own.</li>
<li>Assemble Language: That's finny, good joke.</li>
<li>I think there is no fixed choice, pick the one which takes your less time to finish it.</li>
<li>To me Fast &amp; Quick is primary; Clean it secondary; Reusability is third.)</li>
</ul>
