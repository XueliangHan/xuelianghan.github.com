* Google's self driving car gathers 750 MB(megabytes) data per second, it is capturing every single thing that it sees moving - cars, trucks, birds, rooling balls, dropped cigarette butts, and fusing all that together to make its decision while driving. I'm curiosity about the operating system it used (real time system?), the storage system it used, the data network it used.

####Testing Technologies
* Functional Test
* Units Test
  * As a software develop engineer, after you write a function or a module, you need to wirte a test case to test your function or module, to make sure that there are no bugs in it (caculation mistake, logical error, etc.).
  * Go language is doing a great work at Unit tests, it integrate unit test into language, when you write a function in Go language, you can also write a test function to test a function with defined input test data (both right and wrong), you specify which testing data will get wrong result, which data will get right result, and run test command, you will get result, it automatically, very convenient.
* Integration Test
* Regression Test
  * What regression mean? It's definition is retrun to a worse or less developed state.
  * In my project, a module is working well in previous version, but had a malfunction in new version, so, this module have a regression, because it backward to a unstable state from a stable state.
  * Regression test make sure that new code have fix the bugs, and not break the module's current function.
* Test Driven Development
  * Disadvantage of `Test Driven Develop`, __Creative work distorier__, from Yin Wang's Chinese blog post - [Test Driven Dev.](https://github.com/yinwang0/blog-cn/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2013-04-07-test-driven-dev.md), he mentioned about the disadvantage of `test driven dev` is that reduce the efficiency of the development, after a long thinking/discussing/debating, is comes back to the name, `test driven`, not `speed driven` or `performance driven`, it is designed to do the test. 

####Scifiction and Fantasy related to Technology
