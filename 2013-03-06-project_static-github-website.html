<p><em>Enjoyable writing</em>: With the help of Markdown and Textile, the writing/editing progress has become very enjoyable, I can fully focus on writing, if I want mark text with formatted form, I don&#8217;t need to move my hand off the keyboard to find the mouse, I just mark it with text (Markdown or Textile).<br /><em>Simple publishing</em>: With the help of Jekyll, Git, and Github, the publishing procedure is extremly simple, I just need excute one commond, the new article will be generated into HTML and upload to my remote server, then you can see it on the website.<br /><em>Offline editing &amp; Auto syncing</em>: I can modify any article I wrote before whether there is Internet access or not, because all data is on my local computer, and after edit, all changes I had made is sync to my website on remote server. (Details: I modified many articles which data stored in files and markup by Markdown or Textile, after the command excuted, all HTML files will be regenerated, the time is very fast, then the new HTML files will be sync to remote server, so the website is the latest version.) <br /><em>Backup</em>: Meantime, due to the fact of data is both on local computer and remote server, and synced via git, a backup function is archived accidently, I can backup my local data info external drive, and I can backup my remote server data into other cloud service. <br /><em>Data Free</em>: All the data and information which is produced by you is in your hand, you can do what ever you want to.</p>
