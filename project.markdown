Archived PROJECT
---------------------------------------------------------
(Project property: Independent, Teamwork, Collaborative)
Note: What's in here are dumped from my resume, there are some reasons and thoughts:   
* The resume is limited, 1-2 pages, as time went by, my EXPERIENCE, KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, TOOLS and etc. are all growing, I can't put all of them into my resume, I must choose and put the highlight into my resume, and some of them looks like toys from today's perspective/view.   
* But the things I've done represent the past, they are the past time line of mine, I think I shouldn't let them just go and disappeared, so, I put all stuff dumped from my resume into here, for myself, and also for some people who interested.
